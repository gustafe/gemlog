You're setting up a straw man.

I don't understand why one article by one font designer advocating 4K+ displays is seen as some sort imperative for everyone. Even in the [referenced article] the author can just find four monitors that fulfil what he reckons is his new baseline. The one he reckons to be "reasonably priced" costs $900!

For all the sh\*t poured on aliased fonts in that article and elsewhere, it's not a bad solution for the technology. I use it on Windows at work and I don't get massive headaches (it helps I have correct eyewear for terminal use). 

If you want to use bitmap fonts, go nuts. Personally I find them too small, too ugly, and too limited (generally monospaced only)
