### My response

>  military science

Definitely applicable to this site, where so many people are engaged with Free/Open Source software. I mean, a "force multiplier" would be to aggressively use FLOSS software, but not "waste" any resources contributing back. Life and business is an unending struggle and the only way to win is to kill your enemies, sack their cities, and drive their women wailing before you.

"Superlinear" means "more than linear". Producing slightly more output than input (i.e "making a profit") is basically what running a company is, so this is a tautology.

Again, basically "making a profit", and thus tautological.
