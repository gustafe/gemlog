> That is, exactly the same thing Nazis do, just to the other group.

The Nazis didn't decline to accept a PR from someone with a nick like *WhitePower1488*, filled with function names like `juden-raus`. They murdered millions of people based solely on their ancestry, and started a war with the express purpose of killing everyone on the losing side and taking their land.

By accepting the PR, in the name of "free speech", and "judging by actions, rather than words", you would basically tell everyone who is gay, or with Jewish or Roma ancestry, or many people from Russia or Ukraine, or people whose great-grandparents lost their lives in the Second World War[1], that your concern for the feelings of an anonymous troll trumps their fear that people with the same world view would return to power.
