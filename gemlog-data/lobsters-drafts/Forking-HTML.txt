> I'm sure everyone who thinks the modern Web has gone off the rails has a slightly different list of features that should be allowed

This goes to the heart of the matter when I hear people pine for the "good old days" of the "90's web". Where did the modern Web go off the rails? Was it with the first e-commerce sites appeared (built using server-side CGI, and utilizing cookies to keep track of your shopping cart)? 

Was it when Google figured out how to more precisely target ads for relevance?

Was it when personal blogs metastized into marketing sites? 

Was it when smallish forums got subsumed into wider social networks? 

Everyone will have a different answer, and crucially, these are social issues that don't have a technical solutions. The biggest problem with privacy online is that PII is not seen as a liability (as "toxic waste") but as an incredibly lucrative asset when aggregated. Any change to that view has to be legislative - making the externalities of violating  privacy accountable to companies that work online.
