This can be both a blessing and a curse. I've used OpenBSD before and I respect the system but personally I find the community borderline weird.

1-based ones at that. Why the heck would a "C like shell" not have arrays that start at 0?

On what systems?

I read and edit shell config files maybe once every 3 years when I set up a new system (and I really should have them in version control, I know)
