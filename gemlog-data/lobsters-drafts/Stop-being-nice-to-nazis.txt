> Well, maybe people should stop being offended so easily.

Most of us have moved on. The only ones offended are those that are very unhappy that this site does not accept links that are associated with Nazi imagery.

You are free to engage with Nazis online or offline all you like. But *this site* is not the place to do so. 

I doubt the owner of the repo even knew that it was linked from here. I doubt they even give a cr\*p about the image, or what people think of it. They're probably from the chan culture that "adopted" Terry Davis before he committed suicide. 

But adding a link to the repo was a tacit endorsement from this site that having an avatar of a Nazi office saying "Perfect" was fine. It would send a message that people here were OK with this sort of behavior online. It would lead to people who feel threatened by neo-Nazis __here and now__ to feel that this site was not a welcoming place for them.
