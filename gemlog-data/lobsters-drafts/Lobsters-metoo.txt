Charlie Rose is one of the more prominent subjects of #metoo in the US, and AFAIK he have not been charged in any *criminal* cases - although civil litigation is [ongoing]:

\#metoo was not solely about behavior that was actionable judicially. It was about exposing behavior that was on the level below that[1] but that was pervasive and going on for a long time. It exposed behavior that people "in the know" knew about, but that was "just how things were done", and there was no point in complaining, because these people were too powerful.

\#metoo was about women saying "this happened to me too" - to break the code of silence that enabled predatory behavior from these subjects.
