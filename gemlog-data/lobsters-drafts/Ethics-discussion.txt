Here's the quote from @gthm again, with my emphasis this time

> I’m in the camp that thinks we need to have very serious talks about ethics in software engineering, __but that’s not really what lobste.rs wants to be about__ [...]

This is what you took from that sentence

> “ethics can certainly be important but i don’t want to see it discussed here because it may disturb me”

It's clear from @gthm's words that they'd like to discuss these questions, but they are currently considered off-topic on Lobste.rs. So instead of passive-aggressively attacking @gthm, you should raise this issue with the community, like here:
