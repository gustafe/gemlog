"Friends in liberty! As you may be aware, the international "community" has boycotted food and water delivery, and our own waste has contaminated the local waters, preventing fishing. I'm aware of the thriving market in human flesh that has commenced - please don't fall for fearmongering about the need for regulation of brains to prevent kuru! But as has been the case since the founding of our gathering of self-interested individuals, our access to our blogs has never been impeded - thanks to the foresight of Dear Leader Musk. Go forth and tweet!"
