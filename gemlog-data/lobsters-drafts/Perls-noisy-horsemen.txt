Perl's original sin is There's More Than One Way To Do It.

Perl hackers revel in it.

Python coders fret about whether something is "idiomatic".

"There's more than one way to do it" is Perl's blessing, and its curse. 

Sure, one can write readable and maintainable Perl, but one developer's notions of readability and maintainability probably differs from everyone else's.

Bondage-and-discipline languages like Python or Go are much more effective at enforcing standards at a language level. While TMTOWTDI is the rallying cry of Perl aficionados, "is this idiomatic" is the fretting of the Python purist.
