ICANN is insufficiently regulated and holds an artificial monopoly. There's no technical limitation to prevent everyone on earth having their own TLD. So yes, I am against rent-seeking when it comes to TLDs.

Facebook and Twitter identities are not artificially limited *de facto* - the services are awash in bots. 

And in any case, I stated the following:

I just wish that people pushing Urbit would be honest about the project's ultimate goals.
