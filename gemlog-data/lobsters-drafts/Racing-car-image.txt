> The motion blur is arguably an important part of the original photo in that it gives a sense of movement

It's not just the motion blur. The detailed image shows motion blur too, which makes it really hard to compare the quality.

It's a decent racing car image (if a bit derivative). It's a bad image *for the stated purpose of comparing different compression methods*. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if it's intentionally chosen to make the comparison to JPG better for AVIF - who knows? 

This image could have been chosen instead -

It's a similar subject, but with better light, more details, and has both motion blur (in the wheels) and OOF blur (in the background).
