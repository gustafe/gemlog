In my comment, I was referring specifically to the linked post from lulz.com. It had been literally spammed over multiple channels in what I consider a concerted attempt by its backers to create controversy. It was not argumentation in good faith, but an attempt to leverage reasonable critique and doubt of the CoC into outrage and dissent.

I wrote in some anger and frustration and should probably have moderated my comment to not exclude *reasonable* critiques of the CoC.
