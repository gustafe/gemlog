A person who is xenophobic does not *fear* foreigners, they hate them and wish to deny them their rights.

By extension, a person who is homophobic does not fear gay people, they hate them and wish to deny them their rights.

This is why the term "transphobia" does not primarily mean someone who *fears* trans people, but someone who hates them and wishes to deny them their rights. 

Gleason is clearly transphobic under this definition. 

And in the end, this is just a giant detour. A server in the fediverse is firmly within their rights to ban Gleason for any reason, like him being a male, or having facial hair.
