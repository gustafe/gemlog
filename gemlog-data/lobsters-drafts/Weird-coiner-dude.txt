05:45 < librehash> Thank God the code is open source. I can at least be
                   confident my instance will exist after lobste.rs dies
                   because its a community filled with narcissistic, entitled
                   assholes that have no problem mooching off of the creation
                   of Peter and co., but can't give back to any other facet of
                   the ecosystem.

07:09 < librehash> Shutup.
07:10 < librehash> NAME A PRICE.
07:10 < librehash> FREE MONEY
07:10 < librehash> IF YOU'RE A PRETENTIOUS FUCKING ASSHOLE DEVELOPER THAT THINKS ITS "SO EASY" AND "JUST FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS", THEN JUST FUCKING DO IT AND WIN FREE!!! FREE!!!! MONEY!!! TO DEPLOY LOBSTE.RS
07:11 < librehash> IF ITS SO EASY, THEN TAKE MONEY FROM MY DUMBASS. ROB ME BLIND! ITS EASY, RIGHT?

09:09 < hashfail> $150 in Bitcoin for someone that can setup lobste.rs for me
                  on a PRGMR VPS.  
09:10 < hashfail> First come, first serve. Don't ask me about my intentions - I
                  don't owe you an explanation. I'm making the world better.  
09:11 < gthm> I won't do that. Don't ask me about my reasons - I don't owe you
              an explanation. I'm making the world better.  
          Nicks: hashfail â†’ librehash  
09:12 < librehash> gthm Looks like you're going to fail at making the world
                   better because I'll get it deployed one way or another.  
09:12 < librehash> I'll just continue to up the price until  someone that's
                   unattached & doesn't give a fuck says, 'Sure, I'll take this
                   easy ass money' - then I get what I want, then I expand.  
09:13 < librehash> But that's exactly why the movement I'm behind will expand.
                   Most people would've gave up or went with that shitty
                   alternative 'lemmy', its called? Nah. Not me. I know what
                   this will be good for - maybe you all don't yet, that sucks.  
09:13 < librehash> But thank me later.
