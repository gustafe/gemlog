I'll try.

In [my first comment] on this thread, I made the analogy between the browser ecosystem and the wider IRL ecosystem that exists on this planet.

My basic point was that any action I take as an individual has very little to no impact whatsoever in a positive direction in any of these ecosystems. I made this comment after my (unstated) reflection on the limitations of private, volunteer action in regards to environmentalism. I believe the only viable way to lessen the impact of humanity on the environment are communal - restrictions on certain products, taxation of consumption of certain goods. 

Scaling that down to the browser ecosystem, I don't believe that supporting one "free to play", ad-supported browser over another will significantly help keeping the internet free and open.

(sarcasm tag noted!)

A counter-example: 

Voters in Sweden have enabled a party (the Green party) to enter government, and leverage this power to ensure that gasoline taxes in Sweden are around 50% of the cost of a liter of fuel at the pump. 

Thus the result of an election led indirectly to a policy that in its turn incentivizes consumers to choose cars with better gas mileage. This in its turn contributes to Sweden trying to reach its internationally agreed-upon carbon emission target.
