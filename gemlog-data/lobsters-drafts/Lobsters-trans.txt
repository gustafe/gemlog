> I think this kind of rhetoric is nearly always disingenuous, designed to make it seem like their attempts to censor opposing rhetoric are unquestionably-righteous, rather than themselves a kind of true political censorship.

Whenever I hear or read someone saying “trans people are too pushy” I mentally substitute them saying “women are too shrill”, or “black people are too uppity”, and I afford their utterance precisely the amount of respect it deserves. 

The main difference is that trans people are just requesting the right to go about their daily lives without interference, while people who are anti-trans are intent on limiting that right. There no "equal but opposing forces". Trans people are disproportionately victims of *real* violence, not just online violence, and opposition to trans people's rights is merely the new "acceptable"[1] face of people who have been and now are opposed to rights for women, people of color, and gay people. 

[1] acceptable only in that many people still find the idea of a trans person as "icky".
