> I think sealioning is fundamentally good

If so, you’re in favor of a DDoS on a participant in public discourse:

=> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealioning

In the long sentence starting with "In the context of Twitter and similar social media platforms [...]" you do explain what you mean by the term. It's not the accepted one, however.

> If you read the original Wondermark comic from which the reference comes, 

The comic was a reaction and summation of Twitter culture at the time. The reason it resonated was that it managed to encapsulate the phenomenon so perfectly.

> you’ll note that the sea lion originally came into the conversation because the embittered woman insulted his species in public. 

Nothing in the comic implies that the woman is "embittered". That's projection on your part.

Again referring to the comic, the words uttered by the woman are 

> I don't mind most marine mammals, but __sea lions__? I could do without sea lions.

This is a statement of opinion, not an insult of a species. 

Whether the conversation is "public" is debatable, as the characters seem to be driving through a park, far from the sea, and yet a sea lion "couldn't help but overhear".  Again, this is a akin to someone monitoring Twitter for keywords and jumping in without solicitation.

I have addressed your interpretation of the term above. Returning to the last sentence in that paragraph:

> responses that they would almost certainly characterize as unproductive sealioning.

No doubt these people also misinterpret the term. However, if I were engaged in a debate, and someone accused me of sealioning, I would certainly stop and reconsider my approach. I would also not accept the term unless I were, in fact, sealioning.
