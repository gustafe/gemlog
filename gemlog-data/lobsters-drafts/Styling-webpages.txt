Where is the line drawn, however?

Here's two screenshots from my blog, with styling (amended yesterday after some tinkering based on discussion here) and without:

(I've also added the page as rendered via `w3m`)

Note that I have semantic markup: 

```
    .h1 Blog title
        .h2 Date
            .h3 Post title
```

but I visually de-emphasize the date using CSS. I also remove link styling from the titles, because there's a convention that titles are links to their respective levels. 

Styling also adds nice margins, etc.
