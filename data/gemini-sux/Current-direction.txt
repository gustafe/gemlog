This [post] summarizes a lot about how I feel about Gemspace right now: fun to mess around with, nice to have a reason to dust off mah ole Blosxom knowledge, insteresting to meet new people.

But does it have staying power? Who knows, maybe, but right now my prediction is... not really. I'll probably revisit this in two weeks or so.
