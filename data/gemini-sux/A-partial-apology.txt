Gemini and gemtext: a partial apology
meta-creation_date: 2021-10-16 08:08:52
I've now had a gemsite + gemlog up for a while and I'd like to thank the friendly people who have reached out and who have answered my questions in `#gemini@irc.tilde.chat`.

It's been fun to set up blosxom for my gemlog - again. I've mostly been using amfora as a client but had fun with others too.

It's time to revisit my criticism and address some of them.

### long lines aren't an issue

My editor was misconfigured. I've corrected this.

### no inline links still suck, but it's ok

It's not gonna change. The lack of inline links will force a certain type of writing upon you if you want to use links. But maybe you don't want to. Or you'll use them in a different way.

That's fine, gemspace != web. Getting mad at lack of inline links and finally accepting them is part of the ~~Stockholm syndrome~~acceptance.

### italics and boldface are good, I am still mad

You can't reproduce most prose works without having fugly underscores or asterisks all over. This is defacing our cultural heritage. Asking the user/client to download on the side and using an external reader is a cop-out.

It's increasingly apparent to me that gemtext is well suited for one thing: writing about and discussing gemtext and Gemini. A bargain-basement Sapir-Worf theory, in other words.

### the tensions between developers, users/authors and spec defenders remain

Should a client interpret ANSI escape sequences (ðŸ˜±) to provide italics and bold in gemtext? "Sure why not", "NO!" and "how about we use Unicode to represent italics instead" are floated.

Gemini is growing (cool!) which means the acculturation efforts will probably fail. You either die a pure, unsullied spec, or live long enough to become a bloated, wart-covered compromise. RemindMe! in two years where all this leads - if I can stick around that long.

### so you're staying?

Yeah I'll hang around. It's gonna be interesting to see where this all leads.
