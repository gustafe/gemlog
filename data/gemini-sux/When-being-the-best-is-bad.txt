All in all, a pretty depressing catfight.

@Skyjake, keep up the good work. I love Lagrange, and will continue to recommend it.

To all critics of Lagrange - help make it better. Does it break the spec? It's unlikely, but if it does, file a PR.

Gemini has reached that stage of critical mass where I can tell someone to install Lagrange, to visit Antenna, and start their exploration. If they want to continue using another client, that's fine. But Lagrange is a great entry point. It makes gemspace look good. WE SHOULD ALL BE THANKFUL IT EXISTS.

### Update

24h have passed and passions have cooled. Here are some more constructive links.

=> gemini://gemini.ctrl-c.club/~stack/gemlog/2022-05-10.lagrange.gmi â˜£ StackSmith: Is a Unix Philosophy Browser Possible?

Basically, the browser as Emacs. I'm on board.

=> gemini://gemini.thegonz.net/glog/220509-theAgenaApproach.gmi Metamatters: The Agena Approach

Instead of browsers having, say, Gopher support, just implement a bunch of proxies to translate gophertext into Gemini!

Sorry but no, that's a terrible and overcomplicated "solution" intended to jam "Unix Philosopyâ„¢" into holes where it does not belong.

Well written.
