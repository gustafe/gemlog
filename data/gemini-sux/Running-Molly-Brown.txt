Friendship ended with gemserv, now Molly Brown is my best friend

A couple of days ago I learned that the server I used for my gemsite had been updated to address a serious security issues.

Despite my best efforts and help from others, I did not manage to update to the latest version.

I decided to use another server: Molly Brown. Why I had not chosen it before escapes me. There were lots of servers to choose from.

I followed the instructions here:

=> https://tildegit.org/solderpunk/molly-brown#installation install Molly Brown

As I already had a user and home dir for gemini, I modified the config file for my setup, plonked the binary in the right place, gave it the correct permissions and started it to check for errors.

You can either log messages and errors to a file, or to STDOUT: set the target to '-' in that case.

A weird detail is that normal log messages are in the format YYYY-MM-DD, while errors are in the format YYYY/MM/DD. Maybe this is for filtering purposes.

I then modified the included systemd unit file to point to my location, enabled it and started it.

M-B had no problem dealing with the certs I'd already installed, which was a sticking point for gemserv. 

### CGI

I dabbled in CGI earlier but got spooked by not being 100% sure my server was secure. I feel slightly better about M-B so might enable it again.
