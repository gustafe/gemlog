### Lagrange - macOS
=> https://github.com/skyjake/lagrange
I use this on macOS but it is multi-platform.
Pros:
* nice design
Cons:
* seems to spin the fans a lot

### Geminaut - Windows
Pros:
* nice design
Cons:
* no tabs

###  amfora
=> https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/amfora
Pros:
* decent UI
Cons:
* inconsistent wrapping, but editing the settings to get a smaller left margin helped a lot. Thanks hedy for the tip.

### Elaho - iOS
Pros:
* easy to use
Cons:
* limited customizability

## Stuff I've tried and dissed

### bombadillo
Gopher-first, so doesn't wrap lines at all.
Horrible vi-influenced navigation.

### Castor
Default UI is way too light, no easy way to change it.

## General notes
Keeping these in sync is a fool's errand. I'm going to create a "bookmarks page" hosted here.
