Some housekeeping

I couldn't in all good conscience pollute the Antenna feed with my peurile GNU jokes so I've moved the stuff I want to share there to its own category.
=> gemini://warmedal.se/~antenna/ Antenna
=> /gemlog/ebaums-world/gnushit.gmi GNU is poop
=> /gemlog/srs-bzns/ own category: srs-bzns

You can still get all the stuff from the main feed, should you want.
