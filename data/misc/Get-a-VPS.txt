Get a VPS

I have a $5/month VPS from Digital Ocean. I can heartily recommend it.

I use mine to host my webserver and gemsite. I use it to host a screen session for IRC, Twitter and more. I run stuff like Advent of Code and Project Euler on it. It's great for random Unix^WGNULINUX hacking.

It's the best money I've ever spent.
