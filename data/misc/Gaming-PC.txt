Gaming PC

I am not a PC gamer. I've been an Xbox player since 2009 and lately I've been obsessed with Fallout 4. A coworker has recently updated their gaming setup and offered me to try out a Asus Predator 17" laptop. I don't know the generation but it's plenty beefy to play FO4.

Long story short, I lugged this giant slab home, installed Steam, purchased FO4 and started playing.

Pros:

* really fast load times
* no problem using my Xbox wireless controller
* using windows for gaming with Steam is hassle-free

Cons:

* big (not so heavy, though)
* gamer design, so targetting a consumer 30 years younger than me
* LOUDER THAN A REVVING JET ENGINE

That last one was a dealbreaker. My wife could hear it in the next room over.

So the plan is to try to shoehorn in the xbox + TV somewhere where it's not as prominent, and let this computer go back.

Thanks a lot to Micke for letting me try this out over the weekend!

### Addendum

After I wrote this I realized that I've been idly thinking about the Steam Deck, and that device might just be what I'm looking for as a game platform at home.
