I have downvoted this comment as `incorrect` for the following reasons.

In their [comment], @notriddle referenced and linked to another post[1] created by the author of the post that was submitted here[2]. Linking to an item is the opposite of "suppression", in that it invites users to partake of the speech - to judge if the text criticized by @notriddle for themselves.

@notriddle's reference to "OP" in their comment is unclear. This submission was made by @zge, but they are not marked as author. In any case, there is no option to flag a *submission* as `troll` (as opposed to comments). 

It is absolutely valid to call out the use of the word "autism" in this case, as it's both incorrect (akin to the formerly popular use of "gay" to call out something negative) *and* detracts from the post author's stated aim to inform people on how to protect themselves on the internet.
