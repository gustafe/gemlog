Wow.

The method I learned, and used when helping my coworker, was the `--` option to `rm`.

Nowadays `rm` seems to detect  this and gives a help text:

``` command line transcript
    $ rm -testfile
    rm: invalid option -- 't'
    Try 'rm ./-testfile' to remove the file '-testfile'.
    Try 'rm --help' for more information.
```

This option is included in this article

which is high up on the search result for "linux remove file starting with dash". 

Then there's this "creative" solution: 

> There are some characters that you cannot remove using any of the above methods, such as forward slashes, interpreted by Unix as directory separators. To remove a file with such meta-characters, you may have to FTP into the account containing the file from a separate account and enter the command:

> `mdel`

>You will be asked if you really wish to delete each file in the directory. Be sure to answer n (for no) for each file except the file containing the difficult character that you wish to delete.
