I must say I'm puzzled by your combative and dismissive attitude towards people who are making a genuine effort to learn more about something you obviously feel strongly about.

I know from your previous comments in this space on Lobste.rs that you feel that this community is anti-Bitcoin/cryptocurrency, and you've expressed frustration about this. But the way to deal with that is either to make your case as best you can, with facts and arguments, or to not bother engaging in the discussion here. 

Dismissing people who are making good-faith efforts to learn more as "trolls" is counter-productive and only makes you (and by extension, "your side") look bad.
