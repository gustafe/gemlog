Lobsters comment about Disqus

We seem to have drifted a bit off topic here. 

The main discussion was replacing Disqus (a dedicated platform for integrating blog comments, with identities, spam mitigation etc) with a competing service. 

It then moved on to using an external "sideband" service, such as Twitter, as an alternative to having comments on the web page. 

I raised the issue that Twitter is maybe not a good fit for all blogs, and that Github (for example) would be a better fit, audience-wise, for technical content. 

I never even thought about how this would "work" (create an "issue" for every blog post, and let people comment there?) If people used those issues to discuss stuff that was in violation of Github's ToS, of course they would be banned. Github's ToS are presumably different from Disqus', as they serve different markets.
