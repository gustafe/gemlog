I haven't read anything by JP, nor have I listened to his lectures or his online content. I have skimmed the discussion around him however, and to me personally he sounds like a very unsympathetic character, with views that are very far from my own.

Now, in an ideal world, one should perhaps separate the man from his works, and read his books in isolation from JP's public utterances and views. And it's possible that the contents of the book would be  good and by following its precepts, people would change their lifestyle and be better people, for the good of all society[1]. 

If JP were sincere in trying to reach as many people as possible, and thus make the world a better place, he would be happy to keep his toxic views to himself, to help more people feel comfortable in buying the book , and reading it in public.

That is not the choice he has made, however. He has said and done things that would make me ashamed to be seen reading his book, and to avoid adding to his income by buying it.

That said, I believe the downvote for "incorrect" is unneeded. 

[1]  Yes, I'm purposefully comparing this book, which I haven't read, with the great moral teachings of humanity, for the sake of a rhetorical argument.
