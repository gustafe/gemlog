NOTE 2021-10-07: I wrote these notes in 2020, but as far as I remember I never submitted them to the site as a formal proposal. I may have discussed them on IRC.

I still believe that there's a tension between filtering out "undesirables" and creating a cultural monoculture. I've tried to be as inclusive as possible when inviting people, but the very fact you need to use IRC means there is a filter in place.

## Goals

Keep spammers out.

Don't create a filter bubble by only inviting people who agree with you.

## Issues

* chat invite is arbitrary - timezone, availability 
* if declined, how to "reapply"?
* privacy concerns

I have some thoughts on the invite process. 

First off, the right to invite others, being necessary to ensure a vibrant community, shall not be infringed. Barring misbehavior anyone should be able to invite everyone. 

The current one has some issues:

* a prospective member can request an invite in the main chat, but due to timezones, unfamiliarity with etiquette, or other reasons, not get a timely response
* a prospective member can be declined to be invited, but the retry process is unclear
* the "standard requirements" of showing a Github profile, blog or so on, can be seen as detrimental to the prospect's privacy if shared widely in a large channel.

To alleviate some of these issues, I suggest the following.

* a dedicated IRC channel be created (#lobsters-invite) and the invite process point to it
* the channel will be joined by lobste.rs members interested in extending invites
* once a prospective member is invited, they can leave the channel, thus easily showing those prospects who have not yet been extended invites.
