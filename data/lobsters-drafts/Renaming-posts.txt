Lots to unpack here. 

Referencing users is done by prepending `@`, not `/u/`. This is not Reddit. 

Removing tags probably increased visibility, by decreasing filters. 

Likewise, removing “Bill Gates” probably helped too. This site is probably more anti-MS than neutral. 

The renaming procedure is transparent, unlike on HN. Messaging mods on a weekend and not getting a response for over 8 hours is expected - these are volunteers. 

The suggest button may have been used here, but the changes were so complex that the change was not noted as automatic. I would personally have suggested moving the date to the end.  

Lastly it seems as if you are the user who submitted this content to Proggit:

A link there having a lot of upvotes is usually contra-indicative of a lot of upvotes and discussion here - they are different communities.  Complaining about lack of upvotes is however considered bad form both here and there.
