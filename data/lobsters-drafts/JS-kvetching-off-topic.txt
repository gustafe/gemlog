Your complaints about JavaScript are off-topic and will be flagged as such

I've had it with people who comment on submissions complaining it does not work without JavaScript.

Unless the author is reading the comments and can take action, or there are *legitimate* accessibility complaints, such comments are just virtue signalling. I will flag them as off-topic.

I'm in favor of creating a tag, for example `js-required`, to enable those who cannot access this kind of content to filter it out.
