Qouting from Google's statement in the linked article:

> If you have not taken steps to disable System Integrity Protection and your computer is on OS X 10.9 or later, this issue cannot affect you

OS X 10.9 was released in October 2013. SIP has been a feature of OS X since 10.11 ("El Capitan")[1]
