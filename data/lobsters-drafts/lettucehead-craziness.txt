I would like to discuss this discussion:

However, my understanding is that 2nd-order conversations are generally frowned upon.

I haven’t been able to find solid documentation surrounding this exciting topic.

Rather than linking to 7 year-old HN threads, why not write up a summary with links, and submit that?

… Because that would destroy the non-coincidental arrangement of alphabet letters being used by what i presume are the highly evolved and highly trained primates on the (metaphorical:) other side of the monitor? And ive actually got the ability to read…?

Furthermore, said summary would involve my own interpretation of whatever was said. Why not convert XML (or whatever is normally used… I dont actually know!!) to JSON for I2C communication? Just because you CAN doesnt mean you should.

Perhaps you would like me to write up a summary, with links, of your comment here, so that i can submit that?

There’s no need to be weirdly hostile, I was trying to be helpful.

Presumably you have a thesis (perhaps - “open source leads to genocide”? I don’t know, it’s not clear from the linked comment). Presenting that thesis, together with [links] to the comment on HN by ‘danso, and also the specific comment on io9, along with why you think the thesis is supported, would lead more to a discussion than the current situation, where people won’t have a clue what’s going on.

This applies, mutatis mutandis, to other topics raised by comments here, on HN, and elsewhere.

In summary and conclusion, I personally do not think deeplinking into comment threads is a good idea for this site.

No, i have no hostility towards you!! Where did you get that idea

I find your proposed thesis… Completely counterfactual. Utterly.

Honestly, i am asking a question out of total sincerity.

I am not sure i can get behind the idea that “people wont have a clue whats going on.” Why do you think they are unable to read comments on a forum? Perhaps i actually value their opinions! In fact, i value yours!

Yet how could they post on this very forum unless they already possess, ipso facto (“whilst” we deploy antiquated modalities of expression), the selfsame ability to use a forum to communicate?

Or, perhaps you think that reading a story within a story requires the ability to read while you read?

On the contrary, over and against your own summary conclusion, which i personally find inconclusive, you personally suggested the opposite two comments ago, here:

I read this as sarcastic.
