To facilitate discussion I've linked the 4 comments posted by @itistoday in order below, along with a short summary

\#1. "the" - Twitter search for the terms "Bitcoin" and "energy" from Twitter user [@taoeffect <Greg Slepak @taoeffect@mstdn.io>](https://twitter.com/taoeffect), whom we can reasonably assume is @itistoday.
=> https://twitter.com/taoeffect [@taoeffect <Greg Slepak @taoeffect@mstdn.io>]

All following Twitter links are by the same Twitter user.

\#2. "arguments" - link to tweet, 
=> https://twitter.com/taoeffect/status/913140279573495808
which links to a post on Lobste.rs, 
=> https://lobste.rs/s/selc7k/bitcoin_energy_consumption_index#c_agchk7
along with a screenshot of the post. I encourage anyone to read the replies to @itistoday's post there, no need to rehash them here.

\#3. "why" - link to tweet, 
=> https://twitter.com/taoeffect/status/925834168990175232
which is the text 

> Thank Bitcoin for making its energy usage easy to measure. :D

/#4. "it's wrong" - link to tweet,
=> https://twitter.com/taoeffect/status/782437242639818752
which is the text 

> Energy usage is not a valid argument against #Bitcoin's PoW, but it is a valid argument for switching to clean energy sources.

Note that links 2,3 and 4 are included in link 1, along with some other tweets that can be characterized as quips.
