Echoing @fs111, context is key.

Here is the page before the deletion of the image in question:

It is quite clear to me that the inclusion of the image (along with the watermark saying "9 Rails") is intended to be a "humorous" take on (Ruby on) Rails, as each image before it has been a reaction to some other language. It's also clear from the discussion that it's internal joke that came from image searching for "rails" and getting that image.

So, Rails is like the Holocaust. 9Front will never include it. Got it.

I do not think the inclusion of the image is illegal. I do not think it is even *immoral*. I do, however, find it in extremely poor taste.
