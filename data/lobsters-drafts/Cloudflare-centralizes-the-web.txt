The centralization that actors like Cloudflare embody isn't some nefarious plot, but simply market responses to utter lack of DDoS protection in the so-called "decentralized" web. 

In fact, a lot of the perceived evils of the "modern web" are simply responses to bad actors. Why is Gmail so dominant? Because a centralized webmail service is much better at detecting and filtering spam. Microtransactions didn't take off in part because payments over the internet were perceived as insecure - which paved the way for ad services. 

And of course, a proposed network that had built-in DDoS and spam prevention would probably be seen as unacceptable privacy-invasive, as each and every packet could be traced back to an "authorized" sender.
