Elisp as DSL

(I've deleted my previous reply because I wrote it just before going to bed, having drunk a beer - not a good lobste.rs moment).

Having thought about this some more, I'm going to go beyond personal preference and experience and say that Emacs Lisp is a Domain Specific Language - it's a language specific to the domain of Emacs editor programming.

And [Wikipedia agrees with me]!
=> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language#Other_examples

From that article:

> The line between general-purpose languages and domain-specific languages is not always sharp, as a language may have specialized features for a particular domain but be applicable more broadly, or conversely may in principle be capable of broad application but in practice used primarily for a specific domain.

This fits elisp to a T. 

I wouldn't say Haskell is a DSL just because it happens to be used as a configuration language for a specific application. If in 20 years the only place where Haskell is still used is in xmonad, then it would be a DSL.
