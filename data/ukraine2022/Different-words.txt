Different words

If there's something that's clear to me it's that the words used by some people in this conflict don't mean the same.

From the Russian side, "Nazi" does not mean what it means in the West, it means "anti-Russian". Thus, a democratically elected Jewish president of Ukraine is a Nazi because he represents an independent Ukraine, and not one that is part of Russia.

For parts of the Western "left", "imperialism" means "American foreign policy". Thus, anything that opposes that is by definition "anti-imperialism", and thus good. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is not imperialism, despite the stated aims of destroying Ukrainian culture and identity, because Ukraine is nominally supported by the US, and thus invading Ukraine is anti-imperialist.
