Putin loses a card

If there's one mainstream political party in Sweden that I'd suspect got money from Moscow, it was Sverigedemokraterna ("Swedish Democrats", SD). Their mix of right-wing populism, anti-immigration, and support for "traditional values" was just the sort of thing Putin loved to  support.

But the core of the party's voters are men, older and younger. The older ones usually did military service and were trained to defend against "ryssen", Sweden's hereditary enemy since we kicked Denmark's butt in the 17th century. The younger have been fighting Russia in video games for decades.

Russia invading Ukraine has forced SD to endorse Sweden joining NATO, something that probably galls the leadership. Yet another self-own by Putin.
