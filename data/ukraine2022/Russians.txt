Seeing various forms of complaints about "Russophobia", "xenophobia" and even "racism" from people online, some of who identify as Russians themselves.

If you are a Russian citizen and have lost family members to Putin's illegal war, you have my sympathies.

If you are in custody or have been sentenced for protesting Putin's illegal war, you have my admiration.

If you are complaining online about how sanctions implemented on Russia because of Putin's illegal war are affecting you personally, please consider how your words will be recieved. You have my skepticism at first glance, and contempt if you persist.

### Bucha

The standing of the Russian armed forces would be raised immensely if they took responsibility for the atrocities in Bucha and other parts of Ukraine under illegal Russian control, identified those responsible, convicted them, and sentenced them.

Hiding behind disinformation and propaganda is despicable and does not help the perception that the Russian armed forces are a violent and indisciplined armed rabble, fit only for murder, rape and pillage.
