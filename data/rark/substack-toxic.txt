This post on Wonkette articulates a lot of what I've been seeing regarding Substack lately

Substack.com links submitted to Hacker News are usually flagged within minutes (which is significant, because Substack are a YC-backed company and have been aggressively recruiting on HN). They are full of anti-vax articles and general right-wing culture war trash. Seeing 'substack.com' in the URL is a good indicator that the content will be alt-right or worse.

I won't pay for anything on substack, and I will actively try to flag / delete links to it on social media. There are plenty of competing services for blogging+newsletter. Use them instead of supporting VC-funded alt-right Freeze Peach extremists.

Sadly user 'ykevinator2 got flagged to death for this comment but I think it's quite apt

> I still don't know what substack is but it seems like a place for intelligent nutcases to explain why they're victims.
