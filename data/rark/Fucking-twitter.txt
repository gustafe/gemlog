Fucking Twitter - or rather, fucking Elon

This is depressing as heck. I am convinced Twitter will become even worse, very quickly. The global right is stirring and will use Twitter in its war against decency.

I'm probably not gonna be directly affected because I'm a cis white male, but I really feel bad for "designated targets" *already* having a tough time there. And I really don't want to continue to feed the beast.

Even if people move on to somewhere else, a sort of meta-community will be fractured, and the bad guys have won another battle.
