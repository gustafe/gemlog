IRC vs its enemies
meta-creation_date: 2022-01-11 08:12:17

Services like Slack, Discord and Teams have proven IRC right - group chat is an important collaboration tool. IRC apologists constantly complain that these services are winning despite IRC being better because it's "open" and "decentralized".

If IRC is as good as people say, I would have expected a turnkey solution be available for organizations. This would include:

* server/service with backup and management options
* integration into access systems such as ADFS, Okta etc
* client config to enable logging (mandatory in some businesses)
* full-text searching

Even for a nominal fee this could have been competitive, probably.

But it never appeared. In fact, during the Freenode debacle, the FSF explicitely stated that they as an organization did not have the resources to be running a public IRC server.

The fact is that the IRC ecosystem is immature, inconsistent, hard to manage, and not really business-friendly. And that's fine. But it also means that Slack et al solved a problem IRC wasn't interested in solving.
