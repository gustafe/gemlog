For Meta, the problem is that while people love to *use* Facebook, they don't love *Facebook* the company. When you treat your users as a resource to be exploited, don't be shocked if they come to your defense when your profits are threatened.

I can't really say if I know enough about Facebook's influence in the EU to predict whether this will lead to a huge backlash against privacy and the GDPR. If nothing else, the groups that usually spearhead such movements in the EU are generally anti-FB.
