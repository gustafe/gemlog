HN pet peeves, Nov 2021

* ISO standards aren't free
* YouTube has removed dislikes and HN is not happy
* California building codes
* people not being rude and "direct" in personal communications
* the "shoplifting epidemic" in the Bay Area

That's on top of the classics, like

* why can't I get a date
* why can't I get a date when I am rich
* why can't I get a date when I am rich and racist
* women are the worst, right?
