Stockholm on half a day

In the Before Times (wow, more than 2 years ago) my friend Matt from the US had literally half a day in Stockholm to visit. This is our itinerary.

Matt flew in to Arlanda and made his way to Centralen via train. Bus works too.

He walked through City, down Drottninggatan, past the Royal Palace, and we met up somewhere in Gamla Stan.

We had a light lunch and coffee at Bröd&Salt on Stadsgårdskajen.

We took the Djurgårdslinje ferry to Allmänna gränd on Djurgården, then walked to the Vasa museum.

After visiting the museum, we walked along Strandvägen and had a beer on Norrmalmstorg.

Then it was time for Matt to go back to Arlanda to catch his flight.
