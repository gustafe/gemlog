Yes, music compact discs are obsolete - in one way. They're no longer mainstream. Heck, LP sales are outstripping them.

But also no. If you have a collection, and a player (and you can get a player for almost nothing if you need it) they're still perfectly playable.

(CD/DVD for DATA *are* obsolete).

I found it interesting that moddedBear felt that listening to burned CDs in their car led them to listen to albums in their entirety, because one of the big draws of CDs when they came out was pseudo-random access. You could skip tracks and also use shuffle mode(?).

Anyway, time marches on. The generation nostalgic for compact discs has now overtaken the generation nostalgic for LPs.
