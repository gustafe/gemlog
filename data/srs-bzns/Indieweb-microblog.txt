How to set up a microblog for Indieweb?

Serious question, I'm planning on coding up a quick microblog for personal use to move away from Twitter.

My definition of a microblog is a series of entries, identified by a date + sequence number, but not necessarily having a title.

The HTML5 tag <article> seems designed for this, and I can probably get around the requirement for an enclosed <H1> tag by adding an id to the tag itself.

Is there an example of a "best practices" format for a microblog that plays nice in the indieweb?
