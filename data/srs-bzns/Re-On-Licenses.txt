## Licenses

Just as the old canard states: "the Internet interprets censorship as damage and routes around it", people who encounter software that has a license that doesn't appeal to them should just write their own damn software. This is explicitely encouraged in Gemini which has a spec so simple that writing a client should be trivial. So why harass the creator of a client if they choose another license? 

Choosing a non-free license is a choice. It's saying you don't agree with the mainstream discourse (and yes, FLOSS is "mainstream" now).

The libertarian stance of tech (including the FOSS subculture) is so deeply ingrained it's hard to debate against. Free software (as opposed to "open"/permissive) at least gives some promise of code changes to be fed back to the community, but even that's too much for the permissive crowd who are A-OK with gifting code to megacorps in exchange for "exposure" and GitHub stars.

But even RMS is fine with ICE using GNU software. Why not? Freedom Zero baby!

Discussing these things or problematizing them is fine. 

## Copyright

I copyright all my creative stuff. Not because I want to make money, but because of control. If some Nazis grab my pics to illustrate their posters I wanna be able to sue those bastards.

The *current* copyright regime is too damn expansive, I agree with that. But the solution is reform, not abolition.
