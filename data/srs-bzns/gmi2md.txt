I've written a small utility that will transform gemtext to Markdown. It essentially only deals with links, leaving everything else alone.

Gemini and gopher links are presented via a http portal, but the plain url is also shown in case the reader wants to copy them to a dedicated client, or if the portal is down. 

The source is available on GitHub.
