Securing Molly Brown

Via ~ew, I read perplexing.space on securing gemini servers running under systemd. They use Molly Brown, just like I do.

I followed the instructions about securing the systemd unit file, but ran into a snag. The amended systemd directive

```
ProtectHome=yes
```

did not work for me. I don't know if it was because the home setup for my gemini user is different, or not.

Btw I found this by basically commenting out all changes as suggested by perplexing, then uncommenting them one by one and running

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && \
sudo systemctl restart molly-brown.service && \
sudo systemctl status molly-brown.service 
```

after each one.

Hopefully this helps.

I might try to chroot M-B next.
